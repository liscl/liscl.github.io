<p>This page visualizes the number of french soldiers that have been involved into the crossing of the Berezina. 
As several sources state the number differently, it is uncertain how many soldiers really participated. 
The visualization of the uncertainty has been integrated into the map and into the attribute view of this Coordinated Multiple View environment. 
Hover over the points in the map, the bars of the bar chart or the time periods to highlight the corresponding elements in 
the other two representations. </p>
<p>The top left graphic shows a map-like depiction which represents the geographical situation schematically. 
Hover over the points to get more information about the corps. Click the radio buttons to switch between the representations 
of the minimum, average and maximum number of soldiers. The minimum/maximum number of soldiers relates to the smallest/biggest number of soldiers that can be 
found in the sources. The average number of soldiers takes the arithmetic mean of the values of all sources.</p>
<p>The top right graphic shows a bar chart. The chart shows the number of soldiers of each corps for before and after
the crossing. The black lines indicate the uncertainty range which is based on the different sources that state different numbers
of soldiers.</p>
<p>The graphic at the bottom shows timelines for each of the corps. Three time-ranges indicate the time needed by the corps for each 
of the states (before the crossing, crossing the river and after the crossing).</p>
