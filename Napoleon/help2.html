<p>This page visualizes the number of french soldiers that have been involved into the crossing of the Berezina. 
As several sources state the number differently, it is uncertain how many soldiers really participated. 
The visualization of the uncertainty has been integrated into an extra view of this Coordinated Multiple View environment. 
Hover over the points in the map, the bars of the bar charts, the time periods or the bars of the boxplot to highlight the corresponding elements in 
the other three representations. </p>
<p>The top left graphic shows a map-like depiction which represents the geographical situation schematically. 
Hover over the points to get more information about the corps.</p>
<p>The top right graphic shows a bar chart. The chart shows the number of soldiers of each corps for before and after
the crossing.</p>
<p>The graphic at the bottom shows timelines for each of the corps. Three time-ranges indicate the time needed by the corps for each 
of the states (before the crossing, crossing the river and after the crossing).</p>
<p>The bottom right graphic shows a boxplot. The bars display a range of the middle 50% of the values. The black lines (whisker) display all the 
values that do not lay in the range of the box. The horizontal black lines represent the minimum, mean and maximum values.</p>
