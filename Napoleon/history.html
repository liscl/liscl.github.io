<h1>Historical Information</h1>
<p>Napoleon's Campaign in Russia 1812 was one of the greatest upsets in the military history. The troop
was the biggest the world had seen until then.</p>
<p>The Battle of Berezina took place from 26 to 29 November 1812, between the French army of Napoleon, 
who was retreating after his invasion of Russia and wanted to cross the Berezina, and the Russian armies. 
The battle was the last one during Napoleon's campaign in Russia. It ended with a mixed outcome as the 
French troops lost many soldiers during this battle but finally could cross the river.</p>
