				<h2>Master Thesis - The effectiveness of uncertainty visualization in a "Coordinated Multiple View" environment using a temporal dataset (case study)</h2>
				<p>Abstract
Data are produced constantly and everywhere around the world. In order to explore these huge
amounts of data, it is necessary to analyse it interactively from different viewpoints.
Coordinated Multiple Views (CMV) are the perfect exploration environment for such tasks.
Another aspect that needs to be considered about data is the data quality. The data used
by cartographers is often erroneous, imprecse or incomplete and is therefore called uncertain
data.
The goal of this thesis is to explore methods of uncertainty visualization in CMVs and to
analyse them in context of effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. Therefore, two
different versions have been implemented that 1) integrate uncertainty into the data views, and
2) implement an extra uncertainty view. As a case study, the dataset of the Berezina river
crossing during Napoleonâ€™s campaign in Russia was chosen. After implementing the two
versions with the help of the JavaScript library D3.js, a usability study was conducted. A thinkaloud
protocol in combination with screen logging and video recording was done.
The results of the empirical study show that implementing an additional uncertainty view led to
faster and more correct results. Both versions satisfyed the test users while working with them.
In addition, the frequency of user interaction with the single parts of the interface has been
analysed based on the screen logging data. The resulting graphics show clearly that the test
users of the second group (see 2) ) only concentrated on the attribute and uncertainty views.
Whereas the test users of the first group (see 1) ) have been interacting with all views a lot.
Combining all these results, leads to the conclusion that the users of the first group have been
confused with the interface and worked therefore slower and less correct. Based on the results of
the usability study, the second version can be recommended as working with it was faster, more
correct and less confusing. But nevertheless, the empircial study showed that it may be
disadvantageous for this version if the user does not understand the uncertainty view.</p><br>
