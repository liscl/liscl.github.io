				<h1>Comparison of proprietary (Google Maps, Bing Maps, Yahoo Maps) and open source (OpenStreetMap) web mapping services</h1>
				<p class= "main">
				<a href="https://maps.google.de/" class="text">Google Maps</a>: This well known web mapping service provides different map views (map, satelite) and a variety of overlays like e.g. labelling, wikipedia entries, traffic information, weather information and position and access to pictures and webcams. In addition Google provides the StreetView. It is also possible to search for places and routing information between (at least) 2 places. The satelite images have a good resolution but in some cases they are outdated. Especially interesting is that the data of the Satellite Images is not as actual as the pictures of the StreetView which could confusing in some cases.</p>
<p class= "main"><a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/" class="text">Bing Maps</a>: This mapping service provides different map views (street map, bird&lsquo;s eye view, aerial image) and an overlay for traffic information. Bing provides routing navigation and searching possibilities as well. The aerial images ar more actual than those of Google Maps and have a good resolution as well. But all in all, Bing only provides basic functions and not as much of them as Google does.</p>
<p class= "main"><a href="http://maps.yahoo.com" class="text">Yahoo Maps</a>: This mapping service provides a street map, a hybrid view and satelite images. It also gives the possibility of a thematic traffic overlay and allows routing and search requests. In addition it allows to search for businesses and services. The images are older than the Bing-images but more actual than the Google images. But they do not have such a good resolution. </p>
<p class= "main"><a href="http://www.openstreetbrowser.org" class="text">OpenStreetMap</a>: This map services only provides an map view. But it has a lot of thematic information: public transport, restaurants, sport places, shopping, churches and many more. The map provides search and routing functions as well. According to the VGI-principle, the data should be always actual. But this principle includes data inconsistency as well.
