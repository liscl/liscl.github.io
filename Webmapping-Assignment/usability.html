				<h1>Usability</h1>
				<p class="main">I have chosen the <a href="http://www.gluecksatlas.de/cms/2012/index.jsp" class="text">Glücksatlas</a> and the <a href="http://show.mappingworlds.com/world/" class="text">Mapping Worlds</a> to explore their usability.
				<p class= "main">
				<a href="http://www.gluecksatlas.de/cms/2012/index.jsp" class="text">Glücksatlas</a>: This very interesting web map shows how happy inhabitants in specific areas of germany are. It provides two different maps. The first map shows 13 cities and &quot;how happy they are&quot;. It is possible to rank them by different criteria, to get an explanation of the creiteria to compare the cities and gives information about the cities concerning the criteria. This map is very easy to understand. Unfortunatly it only shows 13 cities. Also the map is not really cartographic. It just shows the area of Germany colored in an orange color gradient.
The second map shows different regions of Germany. It is again possible to rank the regions by &quot;how happy they are&quot; dependent on different criteria. The map provides information in textform and the possibility to get the information at a different time. Again this map is really easy to use and understand.
All in all, this web map gives a lot of information in a very well designed presentation. It gives basic possibilities for interaction. The map is very easy to use and is very user-friendly.

				<p class= "main"><a href="http://show.mappingworlds.com/world/" class="text">Mapping Worlds</a>: This  web map show a world map. According to the topic which is chosen, the countries are displayed bigger or smaller than they are in reality. It is possible to choose from a lot of different topics like politics, people, business, planet and living. Next to the map there are a lot of information shown according the currently displayed topic. There is also a little table showing the ranking of the coundtries. In addition it is possible to zoom in and out, to embed in your personal webpage and to comment and suggest new topics. 
All in all, this map is easy to handle as well as the Glücksatlas-map. It is really well designed, easy to navigate and provides a lot of very interesting information. 
				</p>
				<p class= "main">How I would ensure a good usability in my web projects:
				<ol>
  <li>a simple, neutral but interesting layout. Especially neutral colors like grey, white, black, blue, ocher </li>
  <li>provide: mouse over effects (to display information), navigation funktions (zoom in, zoom out, navigate through the map)</li>
  <li>provide information about the displayed content in a text next to the map</li>
  <li>give my map to friends/family/collegues to let them check it, so that I can work on errors and things they did not like</li>
  <li>give the users a possibility to send me feedback (comments)</li>
