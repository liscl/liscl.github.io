				<h1>OpenStreetMap by using the example of &quot;Schloss Weesenstein&quot;</h1>
				<p class= "main">
				This map shows Weesenstein in the Mueglitztal. This village is the ending point of the hiking route shown in the <a href="googleapi.html" class="text">Google Maps API</a>. In Weesenstein there is a castle. For a project I mapped the paths in the palace garden.
After mapping the paths with a gps device and a walking paper, we uploaded the gpx-track and worked on it with JOSM which has a lot of functionalities. But it is not so easy to use and needs some time to learn how to work with it.
In gerneral, it is quite complex to work with OpenStreetMap. At first you need to learn a lot of things before you can start working. But I think, that if you once learned how to work with OSM it could be quite interesting and helpful. But nevertheless, I, personally, do not need OSM. I think, especially in Europe, where are no big differences in the data of the proprietary and the opensource map services, it is not really necessary. But in contrast, it is quite useful to get maps of countries like North Corea who do not participate e.g. in the Google Maps Project. I also think that OSM is some kind of &quot;sport&quot; or freetime activity to some people who like to explore new areas while mapping them. All in all, I do not really contribute in the project and I can not imagine to do so in the future. I also do not use OSM as a search engine to seach locations. I personally prefer Google Maps, which delivers me all the information I search for. But nevertheless, I think OSM is a good project and I am pretty sure that it is helpful to a lot of people.
